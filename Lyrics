Bluebird by Charles Bukowski

There's a bluebird in my heart
That wants to get out but I'm too tough
I say: "Stay in there
I'm not going to let anybody see"

There's a bluebird in my heart
That wants to get out but I pour whiskey
I take a cigarette so the whores
The bartenders, the grocery clerks
Never know that he is in there

There's a bluebird in my heart
That wants to get out but I'm too tough
I say: "Stay down
Do you wanna mess me up?
Do you wanna screw up all of my works?"

There's a bluebird in my heart
That wants to get out but I'm too clever
I only let him out at night sometimes
When everybody sleeps

I say: "I know that you're there
Don't be so sad, " that's what I said
Then I put him back but he's always singing
I don't let him die and we sleep together
Like that with our secret pact

It's nice enough to make a little man weep
But I don't weep, do you?
It's nice enough to make a little man weep
But I don't weep, do you?

There is a bluebird messing with my heart
What should I do with this little bird?
There is a bluebird messing with my heart
What could I do with this little bird?
I'm turning into a bird, I'm turning into a bird
So I will fly with this melancholy.
